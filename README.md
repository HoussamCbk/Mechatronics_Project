# 🚀 Mechatronics Project | Made with ❤️ by **CHOUBIK HOUSSAM**

# 🌿 **Irrigation System**

## This project is about watering plants when they become dry using:  
+ 🌱 Soil sensor  
+ 🌱 Soil sensor module  
+ ⚡ Relay 5V  
+ 🤖 Arduino Uno  
+ 🔋 Two 9V Batteries to power the pump and Arduino  
+ 💧 Pump  
+ 🔌 Wires
